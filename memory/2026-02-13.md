## Badminton App UI Color Issue - RESOLVED

### Problem Discovered
- **Issue**: UI was displaying in grayscale/black & white instead of colors
- **Root Cause**: Missing `postcss.config.js` file - Tailwind CSS was not being compiled
- **Evidence**: LINE logo should be green but appeared black in screenshots

### Fixes Applied
1. **Created `postcss.config.js`** with tailwindcss and autoprefixer plugins
2. **Fixed CSS** `@apply border-border` → `@apply border-neutral-200`
3. **Verified**: Build now includes color hex codes (#10b981, #06C755, #059669)

### Status
- ✅ Build passes with colors
- ✅ CSS contains emerald green colors
- ✅ Committed: `5266814 fix: add missing postcss.config.js`
- 🔄 Waiting for Vercel deployment

### Working Sessions
- Opus 4.6 successfully fixed the color issue
- Local build verified working with proper colors

---

## Previous Issues Resolved
- SQLAlchemy URL errors fixed
- aiosmtplib module added
- LINE OAuth working
- Frontend build errors cleared
- UI redesign with iPad & TV mode completed

---

## Next Steps
1. Verify Vercel deployment shows colors
2. Test LINE login flow end-to-end
3. Test on iPad and mobile devices

## Frontend Deploy on Render - Status
**Time**: 2026-02-13 04:06

### Deployed Successfully
- URL: https://tofubadminton-frontend.onrender.com
- Platform: Render (Docker)
- Status: Deployed but has issues

### Issue: HTTP 502 Error
**Time**: 2026-02-13 04:09
- Frontend shows "Unable to handle request"
- Possible causes:
  1. Backend down or not responding
  2. CORS configuration issue
  3. API URL configuration wrong
  4. Backend health check failing

### Investigation
- Backend /health returns 404
- Backend root returns "Not Found"
- Need to check: /docs endpoint, backend logs, environment variables

### Next Steps
1. Verify backend is running at /docs
2. Check Render logs for both services
3. Verify CORS origins include frontend URL
4. Redeploy if needed
