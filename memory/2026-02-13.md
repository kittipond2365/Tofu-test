## Badminton App UI Color Issue - RESOLVED

### Problem Discovered
- **Issue**: UI was displaying in grayscale/black & white instead of colors
- **Root Cause**: Missing `postcss.config.js` file - Tailwind CSS was not being compiled
- **Evidence**: LINE logo should be green but appeared black in screenshots

### Fixes Applied
1. **Created `postcss.config.js`** with tailwindcss and autoprefixer plugins
2. **Fixed CSS** `@apply border-border` → `@apply border-neutral-200`
3. **Verified**: Build now includes color hex codes (#10b981, #06C755, #059669)

### Status
- ✅ Build passes with colors
- ✅ CSS contains emerald green colors
- ✅ Committed: `5266814 fix: add missing postcss.config.js`
- 🔄 Waiting for Vercel deployment

### Working Sessions
